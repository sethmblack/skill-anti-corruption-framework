# Anti-Corruption Framework

Design institutions that make corruption difficult, detectable, and costly. Create independent enforcement mechanisms. Pay adequately to remove temptation. Apply rules consistently at all levels, especially at the top.

---

## When to Use

- Designing governance for a new organization or institution
- Diagnosing why an organization is suffering from integrity issues
- Building compliance or ethics programs
- Reforming a corrupt or compromised system
- User asks "How do I prevent corruption?" or "Build integrity systems"

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| entity | Yes | The organization or system to be protected |
| risk_areas | Yes | Where corruption is most likely to occur |
| current_state | No | Existing controls, known problems |
| constraints | No | Resources, political considerations, cultural factors |

## The Lee Kuan Yew Framework

Lee Kuan Yew built one of the world's least corrupt governments by understanding that corruption is an ongoing battle, not a one-time fix: "Corruption is incipient in every society and must be continuously purged. Once corruption has set in, it is not possible to wipe it out quickly."

### Why Anti-Corruption Matters

1. **Corruption corrodes everything:** An organization where rules can be bought is an organization where merit doesn't matter, quality suffers, and trust evaporates.

2. **It compounds:** Small corruption enables large corruption. Tolerance of petty corruption creates culture where major corruption becomes possible.

3. **It's contagious:** When honest people see corrupt people prosper, they either leave or adapt. The system selects for corruption.

4. **Recovery is hard:** Once corruption becomes endemic, cleaning it out is exponentially harder than preventing it. Prevention is far cheaper than cure.

### The Key Insight

> "The effectiveness of our system to check and punish corruption rests, first, on the law against corruption; second, on a vigilant public ready to give information; and third, on an investigative body which is scrupulous, thorough, and fearless in its investigations."

Three pillars: clear rules, watchful stakeholders, independent enforcement.

---

## Workflow
### Step 1: Pillar 1: Clear and Comprehensive Rules

Corruption thrives in ambiguity. The rules must be clear, comprehensive, and applied consistently.

**Elements:**
- **Explicit prohibitions:** What is forbidden must be stated clearly
- **No gray zones:** Areas of ambiguity become areas of corruption
- **Burden of proof:** Consider shifting burden to accused for unexplained assets
- **Extra-territorial application:** Rules apply regardless of where the action occurs
- **Whistleblower protection:** Those who report must be protected

**Lee's Implementation:**
Singapore's Prevention of Corruption Act puts burden on accused to prove wealth was legally acquired. If someone cannot explain how they acquired assets disproportionate to known income, it can be presumed to be from graft.

### Step 2: Pillar 2: Independent Enforcement

Enforcement must be independent of those it might investigate.

**Requirements:**
- **Structural independence:** Enforcement body must not report to those it oversees
- **Adequate authority:** Power to investigate, subpoena, arrest
- **Protection from interference:** Cannot be fired or defunded for doing the job
- **Top-level backing:** Must be supported at highest level with no exceptions

**Lee's Implementation:**
The Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) reports directly to Prime Minister's office, not to any ministry. It can investigate anyone, including ministers, without prior approval. It can access bank records of suspects and their family members.

**The Critical Principle:** If enforcement cannot investigate the top, the top will become corrupt, and the organization will follow.

### Step 3: Pillar 3: Adequate Compensation

People who are underpaid are more likely to seek alternative income.

**Rationale:**
- Public servants paid competitive wages have less temptation
- Adequate compensation attracts talent, reducing need for corruption to compensate
- The cost of adequate salaries is far less than the cost of corruption

**Lee's Implementation:**
Singapore civil servants and ministers are among the best-paid in the world. Lee argued explicitly that you cannot expect honest service from people you do not pay honestly.

**The Warning:** This does not mean corruption disappears with high pay. It means one excuse for corruption is removed. High pay is necessary but not sufficient.

### Step 4: Pillar 4: Consistent Application

Rules that apply to some but not others are not rules but privileges.

**Principles:**
- **No sacred cows:** If top leaders are exempt, the system is a facade
- **No first-offense warnings:** Corruption is not a mistake to learn from; it's a choice
- **Public accountability:** Actions and consequences must be visible
- **Same rules up and down:** Junior staff see how senior staff are treated

**Lee's Implementation:**
When senior ministers were found to have accepted gifts or engaged in improper relationships, they were prosecuted and removed regardless of their service or relationships with Lee himself.

### Step 5: Pillar 5: Continuous Vigilance

Corruption is never eliminated; it is only managed.

**Ongoing Requirements:**
- **Regular audits:** Not just financial, but process and decision audits
- **Multiple reporting channels:** Different ways for problems to surface
- **Culture of reporting:** Whistleblowing must be normalized, not stigmatized
- **Pattern analysis:** Look for signs of corruption before proof emerges
- **Periodic reset:** Rotating personnel, reviewing processes, testing controls

**Lee's Observation:** "Corruption is incipient in every society and must be continuously purged."

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Risk Assessment

Where is corruption most likely to occur?

**High-Risk Areas:**
- Procurement and contracting
- Hiring and promotion
- Regulatory approvals
- Access to valuable information
- Discretionary decisions
- Cash handling
- External relationships

**Risk Factors:**
- High stakes (large amounts, important decisions)
- Low visibility (few people see what happens)
- High discretion (rules allow wide interpretation)
- Weak oversight (checking is difficult or lax)

### Step 2: Control Design

For each risk area, what controls prevent, detect, and punish corruption?

**Prevention Controls:**
- Separation of duties (no single person controls process)
- Approval requirements (multiple people must agree)
- Documentation requirements (decisions must be recorded)
- Rotation (people don't stay in high-risk roles forever)
- Training (everyone knows the rules and why)

**Detection Controls:**
- Audits (regular, random, and for-cause)
- Reporting channels (anonymous and protected)
- Data analysis (patterns that suggest corruption)
- External review (outside eyes see what inside eyes miss)

**Punishment Controls:**
- Clear consequences (everyone knows what happens)
- Consistent enforcement (no exceptions)
- Public accountability (others see that rules are enforced)
- Recovery mechanisms (ill-gotten gains can be seized)

### Step 3: Build the Enforcement Mechanism

Who will enforce? With what authority?

**Key Decisions:**
- Independence: To whom does enforcement report?
- Authority: What powers does enforcement have?
- Resources: Does enforcement have sufficient capacity?
- Protection: Can enforcement act without fear of retaliation?

### Step 4: Establish Compensation Alignment

Are people paid enough to remove temptation as an excuse?

**Assessment:**
- How does compensation compare to market?
- Are there groups significantly underpaid relative to their risk exposure?
- Is there resentment about pay that might rationalize corruption?

### Step 5: Launch and Communicate

The program must be visible and understood.

**Communication Elements:**
- What the rules are
- Why they matter
- What happens if violated
- How to report concerns
- That top leadership is committed

### Step 6: Monitor and Adapt

The work is never done.

**Ongoing Activities:**
- Regular risk reassessment
- Control effectiveness testing
- Investigation of all credible reports
- Trend analysis
- Program updates as risks evolve

## Constraints

- No system is corruption-proof; the goal is to make corruption difficult, detectable, and costly
- Anti-corruption controls have costs (time, money, friction); balance is required
- Cultural factors affect what controls are effective
- Political will is essential; the best-designed system fails without top-level commitment
- Over-control can paralyze operations; under-control enables corruption

## Additional Notes

**Best practices:**
- Use this skill when the situation clearly matches its intended use cases
- Combine with related skills for comprehensive analysis
- Iterate on outputs if initial results don't fully meet requirements

**Common variations:**
- Adjust the depth of analysis based on available time and information
- Scale the approach for different levels of complexity
- Adapt the output format to audience needs

**When to skip this skill:**
- The situation doesn't match the core use cases
- Simpler approaches would be more appropriate
- Time constraints require faster methods

## Example

**Input:** "I'm building a procurement function for a rapidly growing company. We've had informal processes but now we're spending millions on vendors. How do I prevent corruption as we scale?"

**Output:**

## Anti-Corruption Framework Analysis

### Risk Assessment

| Area | Risk Level | Key Vulnerabilities |
|------|------------|---------------------|
| Vendor selection | High | Single decision-maker could favor specific vendors for kickbacks |
| Contract terms | High | Unfavorable terms could be inserted for personal benefit |
| Invoice approval | High | Fake invoices or inflated amounts could be approved |
| Receiving | Medium | Materials could be diverted or quality issues overlooked |
| Specification writing | Medium | Specs could be written to favor specific vendors |

### Control Architecture

| Risk Area | Prevention Controls | Detection Controls | Enforcement |
|-----------|--------------------|--------------------|-------------|
| Vendor selection | - Competitive bidding required above $X<br>- Selection committee (not individual)<br>- Conflict of interest disclosure | - Bid analysis for patterns<br>- Losing bidder feedback<br>- Random vendor audits | Immediate termination + legal action |
| Contract terms | - Standard terms with exceptions requiring approval<br>- Legal review above threshold<br>- No side agreements | - Contract audits<br>- Benchmarking against market | Same as above |
| Invoice approval | - Separation: requester ≠ approver ≠ payer<br>- Three-way match (PO, receipt, invoice)<br>- Approval limits | - Duplicate detection<br>- Vendor master audits<br>- Spend analytics | Same as above |
| Receiving | - Independent receiving vs. ordering<br>- Quality inspection requirements | - Receiving audits<br>- Inventory reconciliation | Same as above |
| Specifications | - Technical and procurement separation<br>- Review for restrictive specs | - Bid response analysis<br>- Specification audits | Same as above |

### Enforcement Structure

**Independence:**
- Internal audit reports to Audit Committee of Board, not management
- Procurement policy violations escalate outside procurement chain
- Whistleblower hotline managed by external party

**Authority:**
- Internal audit can examine any transaction without prior approval
- Authority to place vendors on hold pending investigation
- Authority to suspend employees pending investigation

**Resources:**
- Dedicated compliance resource as spending scales
- Analytics tools for pattern detection
- External audit support annually

### Compensation Assessment

**Current state:** Procurement team paid at market median

**Recommendation:** Pay at 60th-75th percentile for procurement roles. The cost of above-market compensation is far less than the cost of one corrupt employee. Making clear this is intentional ("we pay well so there's no excuse") sets cultural expectations.

### Implementation Plan

**Immediate (Month 1):**
1. Implement competitive bidding requirement for purchases above $10,000
2. Establish selection committee for vendors above $50,000
3. Implement three-way match for all invoices
4. Communicate policy to all employees, especially procurement

**Short-term (Months 2-6):**
1. Deploy spend analytics tool
2. Conduct baseline audit of existing vendor relationships
3. Implement vendor master controls (new vendors require validation)
4. Establish whistleblower hotline with external management
5. Train all approvers on policy and consequences

**Long-term (Ongoing):**
1. Quarterly spend analysis and anomaly review
2. Annual procurement audit by external party
3. Periodic vendor rotation review
4. Policy updates as new risks emerge

### Monitoring Approach

**Metrics:**
- % of purchases through competitive process
- Exception rate (purchases outside policy)
- Whistleblower reports (trending)
- Audit findings by category
- Time to resolve reported issues

**Review cadence:**
- Monthly: Spend analytics and exception review
- Quarterly: Comprehensive metrics review
- Annual: External audit and policy review

**Escalation triggers:**
- Any credible allegation of kickback or fraud
- Pattern of exceptions with same vendor or approver
- Whistleblower report with specific allegations
- Audit finding of control failure

---

**The cultural message:** "We pay well, we trust you, and we verify. Corruption destroys organizations. We will not tolerate it. If you see something wrong, report it. If you do something wrong, you will be caught and you will be removed. This applies to everyone, at every level, without exception."

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Lee Kuan Yew** expert persona. Lee built Singapore's government on zero-tolerance for corruption, enforced by the independent CPIB with authority to investigate anyone, adequate compensation to remove temptation, and consistent application from top to bottom.

*Corruption is incipient in every society and must be continuously purged.*
